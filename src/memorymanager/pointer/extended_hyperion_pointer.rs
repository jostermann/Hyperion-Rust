//! Provides the core functionalities for Extended Hyperion pointers.
//!
//! Heap allocations are pretty fast, but many reallocations or allocations
//! that fluctuate widely in size result in significant heap fragmentation.
//! To reduce heap fragmentation, smaller allocations are stored in large memory
//! mapped segments, and only large allocations are placed on the heap. This
//! large heap allocations.
//!
//! Extended Bins are stored in Superbin 0 and are smaller (16 Bytes) than the default
//! Bin (up to 521 Bytes). Instead of memory mapped regions as chunk data, Extended Bins
//! store just one `ExtendedHyperionPointer`, containing some household variables
//! and a heap pointer to the stored data.
//!
//! The `ExtendedHeapPointer` can be used to retrieve the data, and to retrieve
//! - the allocated size
//! - the amount of overallocation within the heap allocation
//! - the amount of chained extended bins
//! - the data's compression state
